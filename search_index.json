[["index.html", "A Minimal Book Example Chapter 1 About 1.1 Usage 1.2 Render book 1.3 Preview book", " A Minimal Book Example John Doe 2022-04-15 Chapter 1 About This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandocs Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select All formats if youd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, youll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in Preview book, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["p-spline.html", "Chapter 2 P-Spline 2.1 mixed model", " Chapter 2 P-Spline 2.1 mixed model library(ggplot2) library(gridExtra) library(MASS) library(JOPS) # P-spline fit using mixed model and fast Harville algorithm # A graph in the book &#39;Practical Smoothing.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 5. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 5.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.
